# 1. Introduction (Context for Problem Definition)

This mini notebook demonstrates a simple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** workflow using a small sample dataset.

Rubric connections:

- Helps with **Problem Definition** by clarifying what variables exist.  
- Directly supports the **EDA** and **Visualization Quality** criteria.

We will:

- Load a sample dataset (`data/sample_data.csv`)
- Compute basic summary statistics
- Create several example plots:
  - Histogram
  - Boxplot
  - Scatter plot
- Add short interpretations that explicitly connect visuals to potential research questions.

# 2. Load the Data (Data Acquisition & Description)

This chunk illustrates how to **load** and **inspect** your data, covering the **Data Acquisition & Description** rubric criterion.

```{r load-data}
data <- read.csv("../data/sample_data.csv")
str(data)
head(data)
```

The columns are:

- `x`: a numeric variable (e.g., some measurement)  
- `y`: another numeric variable related to `x`  
- `group`: a categorical variable with two groups (A and B)  

Here you would describe, in your own project:

- Where the data came from (source/link)  
- What each variable represents  
- How many rows and columns you have  

# 3. Summary Statistics (EDA – Numeric Summaries)

This section contributes to the **EDA** rubric by showing numeric summaries.

```{r summary}
summary(data)

data %>%
  group_by(group) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_x = mean(x),
    sd_x   = sd(x),
    mean_y = mean(y),
    sd_y   = sd(y),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
```

**How this satisfies the EDA rubric:**

- We report descriptive statistics (mean, sd, etc.).  
- We compare groups A and B, which could relate to a research question like:

> “Do groups A and B differ in their average values of `x` and `y`?”

# 4. Histogram of `x` (EDA + Visualization Quality)

This plot addresses both **EDA** and **Visualization Quality**:

- It reveals the distribution of `x`.  
- It uses appropriate labels and a clear title.

```{r hist-x, fig.cap="Histogram of x (EDA rubric: distribution of a key numeric variable)."}
ggplot(data, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 15, color = "white") +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of x",
    x = "x",
    y = "Count"
  )
```

**Interpretation (example):**

- Comment on the shape (e.g., roughly symmetric, skewed, etc.).  
- Note any potential outliers.  

You would tie this back to your research question, e.g.:

> “If we use `x` as a predictor, its roughly normal distribution is convenient for certain models.”

# 5. Boxplot of `y` by Group (EDA: Comparing Groups)

This visualization supports:

- Comparing distributions between groups (**EDA**).  
- Showing a clear, labeled plot (**Visualization Quality**).

```{r boxplot-y-group, fig.cap="Boxplot of y by group (EDA rubric: group comparison)."}
ggplot(data, aes(x = group, y = y)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Distribution of y by Group",
    x = "Group",
    y = "y"
  )
```

**Interpretation (example):**

- How do medians compare between A and B?  
- Which group appears more variable?  
- Are there visible outliers?  

You might relate this to a question such as:

> “Does group membership (A vs B) appear to influence `y`?”

# 6. Scatter Plot of `x` vs `y` (EDA: Relationships)

This addresses **EDA** and prepares for **Modeling Approach** by visualizing relationships between variables.

```{r scatter, fig.cap="Scatter plot of y versus x, colored by group (EDA rubric: relationship between variables)."}
ggplot(data, aes(x = x, y = y, color = group)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Relationship Between x and y by Group",
    x = "x",
    y = "y"
  )
```

**Interpretation (example):**

- Describe the direction and strength of the relationship (e.g., roughly linear and positive).  
- Note whether points for groups A and B occupy different regions (interaction possibility).  

This directly motivates modeling choices:

> “Because `y` increases with `x` and the relationship may differ by group, we might fit a regression model with an interaction term between `x` and `group`.”

# 7. Linking EDA to the Project Rubric

To fully satisfy the **EDA** and **Visualization Quality** rubric criteria in your own project:

- Include:
  - At least one distribution plot for a key variable.  
  - At least one group comparison plot (if you have categorical variables).  
  - At least one relationship plot (e.g., scatter plot) for important pairs of variables.  

- For each figure:
  - Provide a clear title and axis labels.  
  - Write 2–3 sentences interpreting the plot in the context of your research question.  
  - Briefly mention how the plot informs your later modeling decisions.

Use this notebook as a pattern, but replace:

- `sample_data.csv` with your actual dataset.  
- `x`, `y`, and `group` with your own variables.  
- The example interpretations with your own analysis and language.
