## 1. Dataset

**Dataset Name:**  
**Source / Platform (Kaggle, UCI, gov, etc.):**  

**Short Description:**  
- What does this dataset contain?  
- What are the main variables (features)?  
- Approximate number of rows / columns?  
- Why is this dataset interesting or relevant?

---

## 2. Dataset Link

Paste a direct URL to the dataset (or documentation) here:

`https://...`

---

## 3. Research Question

Write 1–2 clear, specific, data-driven questions you want to answer.

**Main research question:**

> _Type your main question here._

**Optional secondary question(s):**

> _List any additional questions here._

---

## 4. Modeling Approach / Models Used

Describe what you plan to do analytically.

- Type of task (check all that apply):
  - [ ] Exploratory analysis only  
  - [ ] Regression (predicting a numeric value)  
  - [ ] Classification (predicting categories/labels)  
  - [ ] Clustering / unsupervised patterns  
  - [ ] Other (describe)

**Planned models / methods:**

Examples:  
- Linear regression, logistic regression  
- Decision tree (if allowed), k-means  
- Baseline model (e.g., majority class, mean predictor)

**Planned evaluation metrics:**

Examples:  
- Regression: RMSE, MAE, \(R^2\)  
- Classification: accuracy, precision/recall, F1, confusion matrix  

---

## 5. Expected Results

What do you expect to find? It’s okay if this changes later.

- Bullet point 1 (e.g., “We expect feature X to be a strong predictor of Y.”)  
- Bullet point 2  
- Bullet point 3  

---

## 6. Potential Challenges (Optional)

- What might be difficult? (missing data, noisy labels, small sample size, etc.)  
- How might you handle or mitigate these issues?
